GENERAL BART TODO:-

- Embed a Google Map in my homepage.
- Have a Form to allow users to "select" a route.
- Display that route on the map as Markers for the stations
    and as Polylines(with proper color coding) to connect the stations.
- When user hovers over a marker, in the infowindow, :-
       - Display Station name.
       - Display next train arrival time.
       - Display next train departure time.
